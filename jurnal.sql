Several research have been conducted using some heuristic method to solve it. Some of these methods are Branch and Bound, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, and Genetic Algorithms. However, when using GA, the feasibility of chromosome is one of critical issue. Most of optimization problem has constraint functions that will change the feasibility of solution. GA has some strategies to handle this case on the evaluation step. Evaluation not only calculates chromosome’s fitness value, but also handles the infeasible chromosomes presence. There’re rejecting strategies, repairing strategies, and penalty strategy.This paper develops a strategy GA approach with chromosome repairing strategy.
